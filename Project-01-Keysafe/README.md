Project01: Password Storing App

I made this app to store my passwords without having to use a boring .txt file. It’s pretty basic, but it’s my own little creation.

There are definitely better password apps out there, but I just wanted something I built myself.

Heads up: It’s not super secure, so don’t use it for anything super important.
